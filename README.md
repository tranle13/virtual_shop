# Usage

- This project utilizes image generation with OpenAI. In order for it to work, you need to create an `.env` file with api key of your own from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- **Warning**: you need to pay to get credits from OpenAI if you want the AI generation to work properly. If you don't want to, file upload is working just fine.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
